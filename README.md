# Non-cooperative games, LaTeX version

John Nash's seminal PhD thesis that formalized the field of game theory is a beautiful piece of math, it's also short and easy to read (you can read the original [here](old_thesis.pdf)). However, back then people only had typewriters and wrote out their math by hand. I couldn't find a LaTeX version online, so I decided to make one myself. You can read my (in progress) version [here](thesis.pdf), pull requests welcome.
